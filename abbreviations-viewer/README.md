# AbbreviationsViewer

A website for viewing and editing a list of abbreviations used in an organization.

## Before starting

At the level of this README.md file (ie. `abbreviations-viewer`), create a file named `firebase-config.ts`.

[Obtain the Firebase config object](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) for your firebase project, and use that file to populate an exported constant named `firebaseConfig` in this typescript file.

The file should look like this:

```ts
/** Firebase config needed for accessing the firebase app */
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "API_KEY",
  authDomain: "PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
  appId: "APP_ID",
  measurementId: "G-MEASUREMENT_ID",
};
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
